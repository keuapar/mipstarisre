                        &emsp;Let's formalize the library problem. There is a number of books, \(N\), which we need to reorder to produce a sorted list.
                        If we are interested in the efficiency of the algorithm, we look at its asymptotic runtime [link].
                        The runtime is described by big-O notation [link], which describes the worst-case behaviour of the alrgorithm.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &emsp;In most cases, the speed of the algorithm depends on how large \(N\) is, and we are most interested in how much
                        the algorithm slows down as \(N\) increases. For example, if the algorithm always takes \(N\) steps to finish
                        (it might be just checking if the list is sorter, for example [link]), we say it runs in linear time, \(O(N)\).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &emsp;However, when sorting a list, algorithms need to go back and forth, reordering elements, which cannot be done in one fell swoop.
                        So, many algorithms take multiple times the length of the list to sort it. Some of the most common algorithms for sorting 
                        can take \(O(N\log N)\) [link] or even \(O(N^2)\) [link] time. In the last case, as the list doubles in size, the time takes to sort it quadruples. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &emsp;You can see how these two algorithms fare on the plot on the right. As they both take at most polynomial time in the size of the input
                        to finish sorting, we say that they belong to the \(P\) class of problems, our first complexity class.

                        How many complicated polynomials have you tried to solve?
                        It gets difficult very quickly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In fact, the difficulty of deciding whether an equation like that on screen
                        is true or false scales exponentially with the highest polynomial degree
                        and also scales exponentially with the number of variables involved.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This makes it an exceptionally difficult problem for computers to solve efficiently,
                        unless we allow for a specific margin of error.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Imagine reformulating the equation like this:
                        $$(x+y)(x-y) - (x^2 - y^2) = 0$$
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then, you can just evaluate it at more and more random points:
                        $$f(x=5, y=9) = 0 ?$$
                        The more =0 answers you get, the higher your confidence that
                        the polynomials are indeed equal!
