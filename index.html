                        &emsp;Let's formalize the library problem. There is a number of books, \(N\), which we need to reorder to produce a sorted list.
                        If we are interested in the efficiency of the algorithm, we look at its asymptotic runtime [link].
                        The runtime is described by big-O notation [link], which describes the worst-case behaviour of the alrgorithm.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &emsp;In most cases, the speed of the algorithm depends on how large \(N\) is, and we are most interested in how much
                        the algorithm slows down as \(N\) increases. For example, if the algorithm always takes \(N\) steps to finish
                        (it might be just checking if the list is sorter, for example [link]), we say it runs in linear time, \(O(N)\).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &emsp;However, when sorting a list, algorithms need to go back and forth, reordering elements, which cannot be done in one fell swoop.
                        So, many algorithms take multiple times the length of the list to sort it. Some of the most common algorithms for sorting 
                        can take \(O(N\log N)\) [link] or even \(O(N^2)\) [link] time. In the last case, as the list doubles in size, the time takes to sort it quadruples. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &emsp;You can see how these two algorithms fare on the plot on the right. As they both take at most polynomial time in the size of the input
                        to finish sorting, we say that they belong to the \(P\) class of problems, our first complexity class.

                        On the previous page, we dealt with sorting. This is known as a function problem: The input is a list, and the output is the sorted list.
                        Another common type of problem is an optimization problem: Ask what is the best possible output given some input and evaluation criteria.
                        However, for us the focus are decision problems: reframing such that the output is a binary YES or NO.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We can often transform function and optimization problems into decision problems, although the complexity introduced on the previous page
                        does not have to be kept in that transformation. For example, a sorting problem might be rephrased as "is this list sorted?".
                        Obviously, this solves a slightly different problem, and is also way easier, just compare each pair of elements in turn and check their order.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There is a lot of theory already for all sorts of problems, but decision problems are the most examined.
                        Technically, "class P" on the previous page refers only to the decision problem of "is this list sorted?" and since we can do this in linear time
                        checking if a list is sorted would belong to an even smaller class.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Similarly, the rest of this website deals with other decision problems, to which the answers are either YES or NO,
                        and complexity of these problems explores how long it takes to make this decision, in relation to the input size.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We can also define space complexity, which constrains the memory the algorithm needs to decide a problem instead of time.

                        The problem set-up is as follows: You are Arthur, and have two graphs, G1 & G2, and want to know if they are not isomorphic.
                        You have a supercomputer, Merlin, that can find out in no time, but is malicious and will always try to convince you that
                        G1 and G2 are not isomorphic. You toss a coin to choose one of G1 and G2. Then create a random isomorphism of the selected graph and send it to Merlin. 
                        If the graphs are not isomorphic, he can easily determine which graph you used for your transformation and tell you.
                        Otherwise, he has a 50/50 chance of getting it right. Thus, if he answers you incorrectly, you are sure the graphs are isomorphic.
                        If he answers you correctly, you think they are not isomorphic but only with a 50% certainty. Now, how about asking that question several times..?
